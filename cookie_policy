This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies to collect and use data as part of our Services as defined in our Privacy Policy  (“Services”) and which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies.By continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy. What technologies are used?Type of technologyDescriptionCookiesA cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads, host our plugins (for example, the “Apply with LinkedIn” button) or tagsWe use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie may help us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn or interact with our Services without signing in again. A persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our Services (for example, sites that use our sharing or job application buttons). Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session). PixelsA pixel is a tiny image that may be found within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.Local storageLocal storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. Other similar technologiesWe also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy.

Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.What is Do Not Track (DNT)?DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.Other helpful resourcesWe adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising altogether. You will continue to receive other ads from advertisers not listed with these self-regulatory tools or you may receive ads that are not personalized to you.To learn more about advertisers’ use of cookies, please visit the following links:Internet Advertising Bureau (US)European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EU)Internet Advertising Bureau (EU)
